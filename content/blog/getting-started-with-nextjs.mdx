Next.js 15 brings significant improvements to the developer experience. Here's a quick overview of what's new and how to get started.

## The App Router

The App Router is now the default way to build Next.js applications. It uses React Server Components by default, which means less JavaScript shipped to the client.

```tsx
// app/page.tsx — a server component by default
export default function Home() {
  return <h1>Hello, world</h1>;
}
```

## Key Features

- **Server Components** — Render on the server, zero client-side JS by default
- **Streaming** — Progressive rendering with Suspense boundaries
- **Server Actions** — Mutate data without API routes
- **Parallel Routes** — Render multiple pages simultaneously

## Getting Started

The quickest way to start a new project:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-app --typescript --tailwind --app
cd my-app
npm run dev
```

This gives you a fully configured project with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and the App Router ready to go.

## File-Based Routing

Routes are defined by the filesystem. Create a file at `app/about/page.tsx` and it automatically becomes available at `/about`.

```
app/
├── page.tsx          → /
├── about/page.tsx    → /about
├── blog/
│   ├── page.tsx      → /blog
│   └── [slug]/
│       └── page.tsx  → /blog/:slug
```

This convention makes routing intuitive and keeps your project organized.

> The best framework is the one that gets out of your way.

Next.js 15 does exactly that — it lets you focus on building your product instead of fighting with configuration.
